  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: September 1, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>ObjectPoolingTest</strong> (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù, or ‚Äúthe App‚Äù) 
    handles user data. The App is published on Google Play by the developer listed in the store 
    and this policy applies to all users of the App.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>ObjectPoolingTest</strong> is a performance testing tool that demonstrates object pooling on 
    mobile devices. The App:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does <strong>not collect</strong> personal or sensitive user data (such as name, email address, phone number, precise location, contacts, or media).</li>
    <li>Does <strong>not share</strong> any personal or sensitive data with third parties.</li>
    <li>Runs locally on your device to test performance and does not transmit data externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not request or require any sensitive permissions beyond those necessary 
    for basic functionality. It is designed for testing and benchmarking purposes only.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Since <strong>ObjectPoolingTest</strong> does not collect or store personal or sensitive user data, 
    there is no data retention. When the App is uninstalled, all locally stored information 
    (such as test results) is deleted from your device automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Because the App does not 
    collect personal data or communicate with external servers, risks of unauthorized 
    access or disclosure are minimized.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>ObjectPoolingTest</strong> is suitable for general audiences but does not knowingly 
    collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.
  </p>
